# Supported Controllers

All major controllers that are compatible with Windows Operating System should work with Retrobat.

However, due to the management of controller drivers by Windows, it is recommended to use a X-Input controller for best compatibility.

The Subpages of the wiki contain information on controllers that have been tested by the team.

**Controllers will be listed in 4 categories**
