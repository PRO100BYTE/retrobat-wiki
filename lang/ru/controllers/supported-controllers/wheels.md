# Wheels

Wheels compatibility is still in early phase with Retrobat, it might be possible that for many Emulators, specific configuration is required to make it work correctly.

There are multiple wheels on the market, however, only [a few have been tested so far](wheels.md#wheel-devices-compatible-with-retrobat).

## Wheel games detection

</div>

The list of Wheel games is stored in an .xml file inside your Retrobat folder, if you find that some games appear in the list but are not Wheel games, you can remove them from the file and manage your own list

{% hint style="warning" %}
Edit this file at your own risk.

Be sure to save your file version as it might be overwritten by a Retrobat update.

## Wheels Configuration

### Wheel Activation

Wheels can be activated for a system or for a game.

To activate Wheels for a system, from the **Game View**, open the [View Options](../../../en/navigation/view-options.md) and select **ADVANCED SYSTEM OPTIONS**

The same can be done per game from the [Game Options](../../../en/navigation/game-options.md) menu and **ADVANCED GAME OPTIONS**

## Wheel Devices compatible with RetroBat

{% hint style="info" %}
RetroBat does not offer option to play with a wheel without throttle / brake pedals, it is required to have both devices when turning on the wheels option.

The gear stick, however, is optional.

{% hint style="info" %}
It is very important for this wheel that pedals are set to split in the Thrustmaster Control Panel tool.

Also, ensure that pedals are not inverted (this can be fixed by maintaining MODE + L3 + R3 buttons).
{% endhint %}

## Emulators compatibility

The following list of emulators have been configured to be compatible with wheels autoconfiguration:
