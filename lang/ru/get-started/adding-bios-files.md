# Adding BIOS files

Some emulators require BIOS files to work correctly.

### Location

As a general rule, BIOS files must be copied to the `\bios` subfolder of the Retrobat folder:

{% hint style="info" %}
Some systems need the bios files to be placed in subfolders or in other places. Refer to the individual system wiki page for detailed information about BIOS placement.
{% endhint %}

### Missing BIOS check

RetroBat has a "missing bios check" function available from the [GAME SETTINGS](../../en/navigation/main-menu.md#game-settings) in the [MAIN MENU](../../en/navigation/main-menu.md):

The missing BIOS appear with a broken chain icon. The ones where the md5 hash is not listed by Retrobat will appear with a ![](<../../en/.gitbook/assets/image (2) (1).png>) icon, however the latter still can work.

</div>

{% hint style="info" %}
The detailed list of required BIOS for each system can be found in the individual [Game System section of the wiki](../../en/systems-and-emulators/supported-game-systems/).
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
BIOS files are copyrighted and are therefore not included with Retrobat.

The team can not legally distribute them, so you will need to dump them from the original hardware.
