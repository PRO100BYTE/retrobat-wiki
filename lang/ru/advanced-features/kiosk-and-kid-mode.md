### Kiosk mode

The main menu will be restricted, only displaying the entry to change the audio volume.

The game options menu will be restricted as well, removing the metadata editor and the ability to modify custom game collections.

The ability to flag or unflag games as favorites will be removed.

All games will be playable.

### Kid mode

Only games marked as being suitable for children will be displayed (this flag is set manually per game using the metadata editor).

The game options menu is disabled as is the ability to flag and unflag games as favorites.
